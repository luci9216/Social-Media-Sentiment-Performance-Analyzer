# Social-Media-Sentiment-Performance-Analyzer

This project is our attempt to treat an artist’s social media the way a data team would treat a product: pull the data, clean it, model it, and turn it into actual decisions instead of vibes.

We focus on Gunna’s YouTube content and socials, track how different videos perform, run basic sentiment analysis on comments, and then try to connect what fans are saying to how well each video actually does over time.

## Short project description (in our words)

Social-Media-Sentiment-Performance-Analyzer is a small analytics project where we treat Gunna’s content like a real product. We pull video stats and comments, run sentiment analysis, and try to connect the mood of the audience to real performance metrics like views, likes, and engagement. The point is to move past “this feels like it did well” and start backing everything up with data.

## Business / Analytics Goal

- Understand which Gunna videos have the most positive vs. negative sentiment over time  
- See whether more positive sentiment is linked to higher likes, views, and engagement  
- Pull real comment examples to show what fans are actually saying, not just what the numbers look like  
- Highlight which types of videos (song drops, visuals, collabs, etc.) create the best combo of sentiment + performance  
- Build a simple, repeatable framework that could be reused for other artists or creators

## What this repo includes

- Python scripts for:
  - Collecting and cleaning social media / streaming data  
  - Basic sentiment analysis on comments  
  - Feature engineering (post type, collab flag, release “era,” etc.)
- SQL queries to structure everything in a relational database
- Example analysis notebooks (EDA, correlations, simple prediction)
- A reporting layer (Power BI / notebooks) that turns the data into:
  - Dashboards
  - Simple, plain-English insights for artists/creators

## Why build this

We’re a CS + marketing/data combo who love music and creator analytics.  
This project is part portfolio piece, part sandbox to practice “real” analytics work:

- Taking messy behavior data
- Turning it into clean tables
- Asking good questions
- Backing answers with numbers instead of guesses

If you’ve got feedback, ideas, or want to extend this for another artist/creator, feel free to open an issue or fork it.
